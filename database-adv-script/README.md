SQL Joins Practice Project
This project is designed to help visual learners understand and master different types of SQL JOINs.

What's Inside?
sql_joins_visual_guide.md: A markdown file that uses Venn diagrams and simple explanations to visually break down how INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN work. This is the best place to start if you're new to these concepts.

sql_join_queries.sql: A SQL file containing three practical queries that demonstrate the use of each join type. The queries are heavily commented to explain what each line of code does. The queries are based on a hypothetical database schema for a booking/property rental service.

How to Use
Read through the sql_joins_visual_guide.md file to build a strong mental and visual model of the different joins.

Review the sql_join_queries.sql file to see how those concepts are applied in practice.

Try running these queries on your own SQL database after creating the sample tables defined at the top of the SQL file.
